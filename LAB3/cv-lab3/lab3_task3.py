'''
If two images have the same histogram, does it mean they look identical? why
or why not?
‚ùå No, two images with the same histogram do NOT necessarily look identical.
‚úÖ The histogram only captures the frequency of intensity values but does not store spatial information (where the pixels are located).

‚óè If two images have the same histogram before equalization, will their
equalized versions also be identical? why or why not?
‚úÖ Yes, if two images have identical histograms before equalization, their equalized versions will also be identical.
üîπ Why?
Histogram equalization is a global operation that applies the same transformation to all pixels based on the Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF).

‚óè In what real-world applications might comparing histograms be useful? What
are the limitations of using histograms for image comparison?
‚úÖ 2. Medical Image Processing (X-ray, MRI, CT Scan Analysis)
Histogram equalization helps enhance contrast in medical images.
Doctors compare histograms to detect anomalies (tumors, fractures, etc.).

‚ùå Sensitive to Brightness Changes
If the lighting changes (e.g., day vs. night), histograms may differ even if the scene is the same.
Solution: Use normalized histograms to reduce this effect.
